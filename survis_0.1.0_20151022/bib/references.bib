Yet, the problem characteristics and assumptions vary widely and few literature reviews have made an effort to classify the existing articles accordingly. In this article, we present a taxonomic review of the VRP literature published between 2009 and June 2015. Based on an adapted version of an existing comprehensive taxonomy, we classify 277 articles and analyze the trends in the VRP literature. This classification is the first to categorize the articles to this level of detail.},

  abstract = {Parameter tuning is a challenging and time-consuming task, crucial to obtaining improved metaheuristic performance. There is growing interest in cross-domain search methods, which consider a range of optimisation problems rather than being specialised for a single domain. Metaheuristics and hyper-heuristics are typically used as high-level cross-domain search methods, utilising problem-specific low-level heuristics for each problem domain to modify a solution. Such methods have a number of parameters to control their behaviour, whose initial settings can influence their search behaviour significantly. Previous methods in the literature either fix these parameters based on previous experience, or set them specifically for particular problem instances. There is a lack of extensive research investigating the tuning of these parameters systematically. In this paper, F-Race is deployed as an automated cross-domain parameter tuning approach. The parameters of a steady-state memetic algorithm and the low-level heuristics used by this algorithm are tuned across nine single-objective problem domains, using different training strategies and budgets to investigate whether F-Race is capable of effectively tuning parameters for cross-domain search. The empirical results show that the proposed methods manage to find good parameter settings, outperforming many methods from the literature, with different configurations identified as the best depending upon the training approach used.},

This framework was used as a base for the ﬁrst Cross-domainHeuristic Search Challenge, a research competition that attracted signif-icant international attention. In this paper, we present one of the prob-lems that was used as a hidden domain in the competition, namely,the capacitated vehicle routing problem with time windows. The do-main implements a data structure and objective function for the vehiclerouting problem, as well as many state-of- the-art low-level heuristics(search operators) of several types. The domain is tested using two adap-tive variants of a multiple-neighborhood iterated local search algorithmthat operate in a domain independent fashion, and therefore can be con-sidered as hyper-heuristics. Our results conﬁrm that adding adaptationmechanisms improve the performance of hyper-heuristics. It is our hopethat this new and challenging problem domain can be used to promoteresearch within hyper-heuristics, adaptive operator selection, adaptivemulti-meme algorithms and autonomous control for search algorithms.},

As extension to that work, this paper serves two-fold objectives: first, classifying the VRP and its variants solved using metaheuristic algorithms; second, investigating the contribution of each metaheuristic algorithm in solving the VRP problems. Based on a metaheuristic classification, we classify 299 VRP articles published between 2009 and 2017. The results are analyzed to reveal the usage trends of the algorithms and the solved VRP variants for showing the ones that are most popular, and those that are promising topics for future research.},

@article{Assessing2021Journal,
  abstract = {Limited attention has been paid to assessing the generality performance of hyper-heuristics. The performance of hyper-heuristics has been predominately assessed in terms of optimality which is not ideal as the aim of hyper-heuristics is not to be competitive with state of the art approaches but rather to raise the level of generality, i.e. the ability of a technique to produce good results for different problem instances or problems rather than the best results for some instances and poor results for others. Furthermore from existing literature in this area it is evident that different hyper-heuristics aim to achieve different levels of generality and need to be assessed as such. To cater for this the paper firstly presents a new taxonomy of four different levels of generality that can be attained by a hyper-heuristic based on a survey of the literature. The paper then proposes a performance measure to assess the performance of different types of hyper-heuristics at the four levels of generality in terms of generality rather than optimality. Three case studies from the literature are used to demonstrate the application of the generality performance measure. The paper concludes by examining how the generality measure can be combined with measures of other performance criteria, such as optimality, to assess hyper-heuristic performance on more than one criterion.},

  abstract = {This paper defines a new combinatorial optimization problem, namely General Combinatorial Optimization Problem (GCOP), whose decision variables are a set of parametric algorithmic components, i.e. algorithm design decisions. The solutions of GCOP, i.e. compositions of algorithmic components, thus represent different generic search algorithms. The objective of GCOP is to find the optimal algorithmic compositions for solving the given optimization problems. Solving the GCOP is thus equivalent to automatically designing the best algorithms for optimization problems. Despite recent advances, the evolutionary computation and optimization research communities are yet to embrace formal standards that underpin automated algorithm design. In this position paper, we establish GCOP as a new standard to define different search algorithms within one unified model. We demonstrate the new GCOP model to standardize various search algorithms as well as selection hyperheuristics. A taxonomy is defined to distinguish several widely used terminologies in automated algorithm design, namely automated algorithm composition, configuration and selection. We would like to encourage a new line of exciting research directions addressing several challenging research issues including algorithm generality, algorithm reusability, and automated algorithm design.},

abstract = {This paper proposes AutoGCOP, a new general framework for automated design of local search algorithms. In a recently established General Combinatorial Optimisation Problem (GCOP) model, the problem of algorithm design itself is defined as a combinatorial optimisation problem. AutoGCOP defines a general framework to optimise the composition of elementary algorithmic components as decision variables in GCOP. By modelling various well-known local search meta-heuristics within a general framework, AutoGCOP supports automatic design of new novel algorithms which may be highly different from those manually designed in the literature. Within the consistent AutoGCOP framework, various elementary algorithmic components are analysed for solving the benchmark vehicle routing problem with time window constraints and different characteristics. Furthermore, two learning models based on reinforcement learning and Markov chain are investigated to learn and enhance the compositions of algorithmic components towards the automated design of search algorithms. The Markov chain model presents superior performance learning the compositions of algorithmic components during the search, demonstrating its effectiveness designing new algorithms automatically.}
